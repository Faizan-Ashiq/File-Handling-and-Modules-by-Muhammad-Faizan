# Advanced Python – File Handling & OS Automation  
### By Muhammad Faizan (GitHub: Faizan-Ashiq)

This repository contains hands-on Python programs covering **File Handling**, **Directory Management**, **OS module**, **Shutil module**, and beginner-friendly **Command-Line utilities**.  
It is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners build strong foundations in **Python scripting and automation**.

## 📁 **Topics Covered**

### **1. File Handling Basics**
Learn how to work with files using Python's built-in functions.

- `Read` – Opening and reading text files  
- `Write` – Creating and writing into new files  
- `Append` – Adding new content without overwriting  
- Handling file pointers  
- Working with `with open()` context manager  
- Reading large files efficiently  

---

### **2. OS Module (Operating System Tasks)**

Scripts that use Python’s `os` module for:

- Creating directories  
- Deleting directories  
- Renaming files/folders  
- Getting system information  
- Listing all files in a directory  
- Path handling (`os.path`)  

These tasks help you understand file-system automation and backend scripting.

---

### **3. Shutil Module (High-Level File Operations)**

Includes practical operations like:

- Copying files and folders  
- Moving files  
- Archiving and extracting (zip, tar)  
- Safely removing directories  

Useful for system automation, backups, and project organization.

---

### **4. Command-Line Utilities (CLI Tools)**

Beginner-friendly scripts that run from the command line, such as:

- A CLI file search tool  
- Simple command-line text editor  
- File organizer script  
- Backup utility using `shutil`  
- Extensions-based file sorter  

These programs help you understand how real system utilities work.
